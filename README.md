## <a name="introduction">🤖 Introduction</a>

Recreated the viral GTA VI website with React, Tailwind CSS, and GSAP. Build and deploy a scroll-driven experience packed with cinematic animations using GSAP’s ScrollTrigger. Pin sections in place, sync video playback with scroll, and add smooth parallax and image masking effects. A modern, responsive site that brings high-impact motion design to life on the web.

## <a name="tech-stack">⚙️ Tech Stack</a>

- **[GSAP](https://gsap.com/)** is a powerful JavaScript animation library used in this project to create dynamic, scroll-driven visuals. Features include SplitText animations for bold text reveals, ScrollTrigger for timeline control, parallax scrolling, pinned sections, scroll-synced video playback, seamless multi-section timelines, image masking effects, and a fully custom animated carousel.

- **[React](https://react.dev/)** is a declarative JavaScript library for building interactive UIs. It provides the component structure for modular development, allowing smooth integration of GSAP animations, reusable logic for scroll behavior, and support for responsive layout and state-driven UI features like carousels and video sections.

- **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)** is a utility-first CSS framework that allows developers to design custom user interfaces by applying low-level utility classes directly in HTML, streamlining the design process.

- **[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)** is a lightning-fast build tool and development server that powers this project’s workflow. It enables instant hot module replacement, fast startup, and optimized production builds—ideal for an animation-heavy React site with smooth, real-time development feedback and minimal config.
